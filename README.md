# Institutional Buying Strategy (Proprietary)

This strategy is developed by me, based on my knowledge and studies.
This is a powerful, high-precision breakout strategy designed to mirror institutional accumulation behavior.  
Developed from scratch using Pine Script v6 and backtested on TradingView, this strategy has consistently identified explosive breakout moves across multiple asset classes.
